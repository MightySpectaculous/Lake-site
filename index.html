        <td><h1>High Country Lakes of Colorado</h1>
          <p>I have been fishing Colorado lakes since I was 2 years old. As I grew
            older I started hiking <br>higher and higher and found out that the many
            natural high mountain lakes can hold a excellent <br>fishing experience.
            Colorado is full of of these lakes below and above tree line, and they
            are the <br>home of many different speices of Trout that make it worth
            the trip.</p>
          <p>This website is a small dedication to these wonderful lakes and fish
            that live within them.</p></td>

    <p><i>Note: There is a mixed species of Cutthroat that Colorado has stocked in
      some of the high country lakes. <br>This is from a mix of Yellowstone,
      Western Slope, Colorado River, and a few other Cutthroat breeds. <br>I will
      reffer to this as the Mutcut.</i></p>
