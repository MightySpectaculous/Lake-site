      <p>Crystal Lake is a short hike from Rowdy just over half a mile, with
          gear <br>only takes most folks 20 to 30 minutes to complete. A great
          little lake to <br>fish with some sizable Mutcut within. During the early
          season the water has <br>good clearity. But as the summer progress along,
          weeds can grow to the <br>surface of the lake.</p>
